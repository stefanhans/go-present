* About Myself And Go

- doing my kind of 'research and development' of cutting-edge technology for over two years now
- doing Go programming since February 2017
- expecting increasing demand for Go expertise in programming and ecosystem
- visioning a strategy towards a business model around Go experts
- talks on Go related topics are a part of this strategy

* Agenda

- introducing the core principles
- building simple streams
- collect and distribute (pub/sub)
- distribute between two
- distribute between many
- buffer and flush
- fold and aggregate
- convert data types statically

Is that enough?

- meta channel, composites, registration, and APIs


* The core principles of 'Functional Streaming' (as I mean it)

- node-like structs with one main loop goroutine connected via edge-like channels are the basic components handling data streams
- functions called in the main loop control or transform the data streams
- crucial parts of structs and main loops, respectively, can be exchanged during flowing data streams
- exchange of meta information and reactions to it

Let's see what can we achieve with the first three ideas for a start.


* Building Streams (1/4)

.code functionalstreams/node_of_int.go /START_1/,/END_1/
.code functionalstreams/node_of_int.go /START_2/,/END_2/


* Building Streams (2/4)

.play -edit sn_connect.go /func main/,/^}/

Best to avoid deadlocks is to implement in the following order:

1st: finish node creation
2nd: finish stream configuration
3rd: start sending data
4th: change function via channel (optional)


* Building Streams (3/4)

Declare and initialize a new node
.code functionalstreams/node_of_int.go /START_3/,/END_3/

Connects the output of one node with the input of another
.code functionalstreams/node_of_int.go /START_5/,/END_5/


* Building Streams (4/4)

Helper function to show output
.code functionalstreams/util_of_int.go /START_PRINTF/,/END_PRINTF/

Helper function to produce input
.code functionalstreams/util_of_int.go /START_3/,/END_3/

Exchange the function of a node
.code functionalstreams/node_of_int.go /START_SETFUNC/,/END_SETFUNC/


* Higher-Order Function Map

.code functionalstreams/node_of_int.go /START_MAP/,/END_MAP/
.play -edit map.go /func main/,/^}/

The node which is following *node_1* is anonymous and not accessible


* Collect Streams

Collecting streams is easy
.play -edit sn_collector.go /func main/,/^}/


* Distribute Streams (1/5)

Distributing streams is more sophisticated
.code functionalstreams/distributor_of_int.go /START_SUBSCRIPTION/,/END_SUBSCRIPTION/
Subscriptions are introduced, and handled by distributor nodes
.code functionalstreams/distributor_of_int.go /START_1/,/END_1/


* Distribute Streams (2/5)

.code functionalstreams/distributor_of_int.go /START_2/,/END_2/


* Distribute Streams (3/5)

.code functionalstreams/distributor_of_int.go /START_3/,/END_3/


* Distribute Streams (4/5)
Connect a distributor to a node
.code functionalstreams/distributor_of_int.go /START_CONNECTD/,/END_CONNECTD/
Subscribe to and unsubscribe from a distributor
.code functionalstreams/distributor_of_int.go /START_SUBSCRIBE/,/END_SUBSCRIBE/


* Distribute Streams (5/5)

.play -edit sn_distributor.go /START_6/,/END_6/


* Tee Streams (1/2)

.code functionalstreams/distributor_of_int.go /START_TEE/,/END_TEE/

* Tee Streams (2/2)

.play -edit sn_tee.go /func main/,/^}/


* Higher-Order Function Filter (1/2)

.code functionalstreams/distributor_of_int.go /START_FILTER/,/END_FILTER/


* Higher-Order Function Filter (2/2)

.play -edit sn_filter.go /func main/,/^}/


* Switch Streams (1/2)

.code functionalstreams/distributor_of_int.go /START_SWITCH/,/END_SWITCH/

* Switch Streams (2/2)

.play -edit sn_switch.go /func main/,/^}/


* Distributing Functions (1/2)

Distribute and copy to all subscribers
.code functionalstreams/distributor_of_int.go /START_TOALL/,/END_TOALL/
Distribute round-robin
.code functionalstreams/distributor_of_int.go /START_RR/,/END_RR/

* Distributing Functions (2/2)

.play -edit sn_distribute_functions.go /func main/,/^}/


* Buffer and Flush (1/5)

.code functionalstreams/buffer_of_int.go /START_1/,/END_1/
.code functionalstreams/buffer_of_int.go /START_3/,/END_3/


* Buffer and Flush (2/5)

.code functionalstreams/buffer_of_int.go /START_2/,/END_2/


* Buffer and Flush (3/5)
Values will be buffered and flushed
.code functionalstreams/buffer_of_int.go /START_BUFFER/,/END_BUFFER/
.code functionalstreams/buffer_of_int.go /START_FLUSH/,/END_FLUSH/
Set a control function using input, length, and capacity of the buffer
.code functionalstreams/buffer_of_int.go /START_FUNC/,/END_FUNC/


* Buffer and Flush (4/5)

.play -edit sn_buffer.go /func main/,/^}/


* Buffer and Flush (5/5)

.play -edit sn_buffer_func.go /START_BUFFUNC/,/END_BUFFUNC/


* Higher-Order Function Fold (1/3)

.code functionalstreams/folder_of_int.go /START_1/,/END_1/
.code functionalstreams/folder_of_int.go /START_3/,/END_3/


* Higher-Order Function Fold (2/3)

.code functionalstreams/monad_of_int.go /START_1/,/END_1/
.code functionalstreams/monad_of_int.go /START_2/,/END_2/
.code functionalstreams/folder_of_int.go /START_2/,/END_2/


* Higher-Order Function Fold (3/3)

.code functionalstreams/folder_of_int.go /START_RESULT/,/END_RESULT/
.play -edit sn_folder.go /func main/,/^}/
Assigning another monad to variable used in *NewFolderOfInt* has no effect


* Aggregate (1/3)

.code functionalstreams/aggregator_of_int.go /START_1/,/END_1/
.code functionalstreams/aggregator_of_int.go /START_3/,/END_3/


* Aggregate (2/3)

.code functionalstreams/aggregator_of_int.go /START_2/,/END_2/
.code functionalstreams/aggregator_of_int.go /START_RESET/,/END_RESET/


* Aggregate (3/3)

.play -edit sn_aggregator.go /func main/,/^}/


* Convert Statically (1/3)

.code functionalstreams/converter_int_to_float.go /START_1/,/END_1/
.code functionalstreams/converter_int_to_float.go /START_3/,/END_3/


* Convert Statically (2/3)

.code functionalstreams/converter_int_to_float.go /START_2/,/END_2/
.code functionalstreams/node_of_int.go /START_CONNECTCONVERTER/,/END_CONNECTCONVERTER/
.code functionalstreams/converter_int_to_float.go /START_CONNECT/,/END_CONNECT/


* Convert Statically (3/3)

.play -edit sn_converter_int_to_float.go /func main/,/^}/
